# Later — small issues & tech-debt log

A running list of **small** issues and tech-debt notes worth tracking but not worth a
full spec or bug report. Add an item when you notice debt or a minor rough edge in
passing; remove it once it's addressed. Keep entries short.

**What belongs here:** minor rough edges, "we picked X ad-hoc, should we standardize?",
small cleanups, follow-ups too small to spec. **What does *not*:** anything that grows
into a real feature or a genuine bug — those graduate to `docs/plans/` (a spec) or a
proper issue.

**Entry format:**

```
- **<short title>** — _added YYYY-MM-DD_
  One or two lines of context / why it matters.
  _Done when:_ the concrete condition that lets us delete this entry.
```

## Oversized route pages to componentize

The `src/routes/**` page components were intentionally left out of the front-end
test sweep — routes are integration glue (params → API load → pass to child
components → navigate), and that glue belongs to a future E2E track, not unit
tests (see `docs/designs/frontend-testing.md`). Most route pages are thin glue
and fine as-is. But several have grown large by mixing that glue with significant
**inline logic and sub-views** that were never extracted into components.

When the UI-organization / clarity pass reaches each of these, break the inline
logic and sub-views out into components (and lib helpers) — the same pattern that
made the rest of the SPA testable — then unit-test the extracted pieces. Don't
wrap a 1000-line page in heavy mocks; extract first.

**Primary (≥ 400 lines, as of 2026-06-04):**

- `change-orders/ChangeOrderDetailPage.svelte` — **1038** (by far the largest; top priority)
- `jobs/TaskDetailPage.svelte` — 527
- `Search.svelte` — 499
- `purchaseorders/PurchaseOrderDetailPage.svelte` — 461
- `jobs/JobTaskListPage.svelte` — 427
- `jobs/JobShipmentsPage.svelte` — 418
- `worksheets/WorksheetDetailPage.svelte` — 407

**Watch list (300–365 lines):** `schedule/SchedulePage.svelte` (365),
`estimates/EstimateDetailPage.svelte` (344), `users/UserDetailPage.svelte` (306),
`contacts/ContactListPage.svelte` (301).

_Done when:_ each oversized route has had its UI pass with inline logic/sub-views
extracted into (tested) components, or a deliberate note recorded for why a given
page stays whole.

> Related: `components/jobs/JobDetail.svelte` is a similarly oversized
> **component** (not a route). It has a mount-only test today; its deep
> derivations (version timeline, CO delta layering) warrant the same
> extract-and-unit-test treatment. Noted in `docs/designs/frontend-testing.md`.

## Open

- **Verify the portal hides Accept/Reject when an estimate isn't actionable.** — _added 2026-06-05_
  Backend already gates this: `_is_actionable` (`apps/api/portal/views.py`) requires the
  job to be `SUBMITTED`, so an on-hold (or otherwise moved-on) job returns `actions: []`
  and `_decide` is a no-op. Confirm the portal **UI** (`frontend/portal/`) actually
  suppresses the Accept/Reject buttons when `actionable` is false / `actions` is empty,
  rather than showing dead buttons that POST to a no-op. _Done when:_ the portal page
  renders no Accept/Reject controls for a non-actionable estimate (verified for the
  on-hold-job case specifically).

- **Earmarking is done per-material and then overwritten — do we need both layers?** — _added 2026-06-05_
  `MaterialService.create_on_job` calls `_mutate_earmark` (incremental; its docstring
  calls it "the sole writer of Earmark rows"), but the bulk job-population paths then
  call `InventoryService.create_earmarks_for_job`, which aggregates all the job's
  inventoried Materials by PLI and **overwrites** each Earmark to the absolute total.
  In a copy/population path the per-material increments already produce the correct
  total, so the final aggregate sweep looks redundant. Work out the intended division
  of labor (steady-state incremental edits vs one-shot bulk-population sweep), whether
  any path materializes Materials *without* `create_on_job` (which is what would make
  the sweep load-bearing), and whether one layer can be dropped without breaking
  idempotency. _Done when:_ we've documented why both exist (in
  `materials-inventory-and-purchasing.md`) or removed the redundant layer.
  _History (for context):_ earmarking was originally an `auto_earmark_inventory`
  signal on `estimate_accepted`, which only fired on the acceptance path (template and
  worksheet-copy paths got zero earmarks). Commit `9848a4c` (2026-04-05) deleted that
  signal and made earmarking a step inside *each* materialization path, establishing the
  invariant "every path that materializes work earmarks." Two weeks later `AtomCarryOverService`
  (`fdc3650`/`09031e3`, 2026-04-20) re-attached materialization to `estimate_accepted`
  but **without** the earmark step — silently breaking that invariant. A stale test
  (`test_accepting_estimate_does_not_create_earmarks`, also from `9848a4c`) kept passing
  because it guarded "the signal is gone," not "materialization earmarks," so it masked
  the regression. Fixed 2026-06-05 by routing carry-over through the shared
  `materialize_worksheet_onto_job` core, which earmarks; the test was inverted to
  `test_accepting_estimate_creates_earmarks`. So both earmark layers now run on that path:
  `create_on_job`'s incremental writes **plus** the final aggregate sweep — which is the
  redundancy this item is about.

- **Audit `$state` seeded from a prop — stale on prop change.** — _added 2026-06-04_
  The Svelte compiler warns `state_referenced_locally` in `Accordion.svelte`
  (`let isOpen = $state(open)`) and `TagEditor.svelte` (`let tags = $state([...initialTags])`):
  local `$state` initialized from a prop captures only the prop's *initial* value, so if the
  parent later changes that prop the component won't react. Harmless where the prop is
  effectively mount-only (current usage), a latent bug if it ever updates. Surfaced while
  writing component tests (the tests don't exercise the prop-change path).
  _Done when:_ the `$state`-seeded-from-prop sites have been grepped, and each is either
  confirmed mount-only or converted (e.g. `$derived`, or a reset via `$effect`).

- **`CollapsedTab` default `theme='gray'` isn't in `THEMES` — renders crash with no theme.** — _added 2026-06-04_
  `CollapsedTab.svelte`'s `theme` prop defaults to `'gray'`, but `THEMES` has no `gray`
  key, so `colors = THEMES[theme] || THEMES.gray` resolves to `undefined` and the
  template's `colors.bg` throws. Harmless today because the board always passes a real
  theme, but the default value is unusable (CLAUDE.md pitfall #3, "defaults not in
  choices"). Surfaced while writing the component test (tested with real themes).
  _Done when:_ the default `theme` is a valid `THEMES` key (or `THEMES` gains a `gray`
  fallback entry).

- **Deliverable freeze under the no-estimate case.** — _added 2026-06-01_
  The job-duplicate "immediately approved" path produces a Job with **no estimate** —
  deliverables, tasks, materials only. `DeliverableService.is_editable` keys on estimate /
  CO state, so a no-estimate job's deliverables stay **editable in any status**, tightening
  only as rows **anchor** (gain a `ShipmentItem`). Accepted for now, but we may want a
  harder freeze point for no-estimate jobs (e.g. freeze on `in_progress`, or on first
  shipment regardless of which row) so the agreed scope can't drift indefinitely. Revisit
  if loose-forever deliverables on a duplicated approved job cause trouble in practice.
  _Done when:_ we've decided whether no-estimate jobs need a status-based deliverable
  freeze and either added one or recorded why anchoring alone is sufficient.
- **Audit Configuration keys for settings-UI coverage.** — _added 2026-05-31_
  Some Configuration keys have no user-facing editor — `our_public_url` had none until
  the Business tab was added, and others likely lack UI too. Review every key the
  backend reads/writes (document-number sequences/counters, units, QBO accounts, email
  templates, retention/expiry days, `our_domain`, schedule keys, etc.) and make sure
  each user-settable one is editable somewhere in Settings. Exclude auto-managed keys
  (e.g. counters that increment on their own) from needing an editor.
  _Done when:_ every user-settable Configuration key has a settings-UI editor, and the
  audit has confirmed nothing is silently un-editable.

- **Send-email form: accept comma-separated recipients in To and Bcc, not just Cc.** — _added 2026-05-31_
  The document-send form (`DocumentSendForm.svelte`) accepts a comma-separated list in
  the Cc box but the To field doesn't take one; Bcc unverified. All three (To / Cc /
  Bcc) should accept a comma-separated list of addresses consistently.
  _Done when:_ To, Cc, and Bcc each accept and correctly send to a comma-separated list.

- **Outbound drafts: save composed-but-not-sent state.** — _added 2026-05-30_
  Both the document-send pages (Estimate / PO / Invoice) and the inline reply composer
  intentionally have no draft state. SMTP failure with a page reload loses whatever the
  user typed. Acceptable until real complaints surface — at which point the natural shape
  is a `direction='outbound', sent_at=null, last_send_error=''` EmailRecord (the "in
  flight" state currently never persists) plus a SPA list of "Drafts" on the inbox page.
  Reply drafts probably want the most attention since freeform replies can be long.
  _Done when:_ user can leave a send page mid-compose, come back later, and the form
  pre-fills with what was there.

- **Send outbound documents as a reply to the customer's most recent inbound thread.** — _added 2026-05-30_
  When sending an Estimate / PO / Invoice, look up the latest `direction='inbound'`
  EmailRecord linked to the document's Job (or PO / Bill), and set the outbound's
  `In-Reply-To` + `References` headers so the customer sees the doc in the same Gmail
  thread as their inquiry. Today we always send a fresh standalone email — works fine
  but means customers see two separate threads. Probably a per-document Configuration
  toggle ("thread document emails into recent customer threads by default") when this
  lands. _Done when:_ outbound document emails optionally thread into the parent
  conversation and customer mail clients see proper threading.

- **Sent-folder upload via IMAP APPEND.** — _added 2026-05-30_
  Outbound emails sent by Minibini don't appear in the user's Gmail web "Sent" folder
  — they go out through SMTP and we keep our own EmailRecord, but the user's mail
  client doesn't know about them. Append each successful outbound to the configured
  Sent folder via IMAP so the user sees a consistent picture across our app and Gmail.
  Off the critical path; nice-to-have. _Done when:_ sent emails from Minibini appear
  in the user's Gmail Sent folder alongside emails they sent through Gmail directly.

- **Forward action in the reply composer.** — _added 2026-05-30_
  Standard mail-client Forward — different prefill from Reply (no recipient, `Fwd:`
  subject, body becomes the quoted original, original attachments included). Not in
  the inline composer today. _Done when:_ the action panel has a Forward button
  alongside Reply / Reply All and the composer handles the Forward prefill shape.

- **Subject-line parsing fallback for forwarded-rather-than-replied correlation.** — _added 2026-05-30_
  Reply correlation uses In-Reply-To / References, which most replies preserve.
  Forwards typically drop the threading headers, so a forwarded reply lands
  unassociated. Could grep the subject for our outbound document numbers
  (`EST-2026-0001`, `PO-…`, `INV-…`) as a fallback. Only worth doing if forwards
  turn out to be a noticeable miss rate. _Done when:_ a measurable rate of
  forwarded-replies-to-documents auto-associate to the right object.

- **Multiple "our own" addresses for Reply-All filtering.** — _added 2026-05-30_
  The Reply-All CC computation strips only the single `EMAIL_HOST_USER` address from
  the list of original recipients. If the shop ever polls multiple accounts or
  accepts mail at aliases, the user could see their own alias end up in CC. _Done
  when:_ Reply-All strips any of the configured "our own" addresses (probably a
  small list pulled from a new Configuration key).

- **Thread view in the SPA.** — _added 2026-05-30_
  Show all emails in a thread together (with their shared and individual
  associations) instead of inbox rows that hide the structure. The
  thread-association propagation feature ensures the data is now correctly
  per-thread, so a thread view would just render what's already coherent. Real UX
  improvement; out of scope when the propagation feature shipped. _Done when:_ the
  email inbox has a thread-grouped view; clicking a thread shows the conversation
  with the shared FK associations at the top and per-email details below.

- **Bulk operations across a thread.** — _added 2026-05-30_
  "Mark whole thread as read," "delete whole thread," "disassociate the whole
  thread from Job X." Different from per-email actions (already present) — these
  would operate over the thread membership set computed by
  `collect_thread_member_ids`. Pair with the thread-view follow-up since the UI
  surface for invoking these is the natural place. _Done when:_ the SPA has at
  least one thread-level bulk action wired up.

- **Customer-facing public URLs for documents (`{object_url}` real resolution) — ESTIMATES DONE.** — _added 2026-05-29; estimates resolved 2026-05-31_
  Estimates are now fully shipped: `Estimate.public_token` is minted at creation;
  `build_object_url('estimate', id)` resolves to `/portal/?token=<token>`; the
  `/api/portal/estimates/<token>/` read/accept/reject endpoints are live (AllowAny,
  token-authorized); the customer page is at `frontend/portal/` (second Vite entry).
  See `estimates-and-prices.md` §15.1 for the full spec.
  **Remaining:** PO / Invoice / Bill public URLs (no token column, no portal view);
  Change Order customer approval (blocked on CO send-to-customer flow — no CO PDF,
  no CO email service, no CO entry in `build_object_url`).

- **Audit error-message surfacing across the SPA for consistency.** — _added 2026-05-29_
  Inconsistencies noticed in passing: some pages surface API errors via the global
  `lib/api.js` overlay, some via inline `<p><strong>Error:</strong> {message}</p>` rows
  under the form, some via field-level errors derived from DRF's `e.data`, and the
  Invoice send dialog uses `e.data?.error || e.message`. The set of envelope shapes the
  backend returns is also a bit mixed — some endpoints return `{'detail': '…'}`, some
  `{'<field>': ['…']}`, some `{'error': '…'}`. The user-visible result is that the same
  kind of failure can look quite different depending on where it happens. _Done when:_ a
  quick pass has catalogued the variants, agreed on a small set of envelope shapes the
  backend uses consistently, and the SPA's error display has been normalized to match
  (probably: lean on `lib/api.js` overlays for unexpected errors, inline rows for
  field-validation responses).

- **Email attachments aren't downloadable.** — _added 2026-05-28_
  `EmailContent.svelte` and the deprecated `email_detail.html` template both render
  attachments as `<strong>{filename}</strong> ({content_type}, {size} bytes)` — no
  download link. The IMAP service used to ship the raw `payload` bytes inside the JSON
  response, which 500'd for any non-UTF-8 attachment (commit `<this-one>` strips
  `payload` from the service contract); the SPA never used the bytes anyway. _Done
  when:_ a streaming endpoint exists (e.g. `GET /api/emails/{id}/attachments/{index}/`)
  that re-fetches by UID, returns the bytes with correct `Content-Type` and
  `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=…`, and the email detail page wraps the
  filename in an `<a href>` to it. Decide at that time whether to cache attachment
  bytes on `TempEmail` (avoids IMAP-per-click) or keep the streaming-from-IMAP shape.

- **Email-association pickers cap the dropdown at 100 entries and sort poorly.** — _added 2026-05-28_
  `EmailAssociatePage.svelte` (jobs) and, once they land, the equivalent PO and Bill
  pickers all request `?page_size=500` to populate a `<select>`, but
  `StandardPagination.max_page_size = 100` silently caps it. Fine while each table is
  under 100 rows; once any of them crosses that, only the most recently-created entries
  are reachable. The pickers also lean on each list endpoint's default ordering, which
  isn't always what a human would call "most recent" — `Job` sorts by `-created_date`
  (fine), but PO/Bill defaults need a deliberate decision (a job's `start_date` or last
  status change is arguably more relevant than its creation; a PO's issue/sent date
  beats its created_at; a Bill's bill_date or due_date may matter more than its
  created_at). _Done when:_ each picker either paginates / searches server-side
  (typeahead against `?search=`) or filters to "active" statuses only AND sorts by a
  human-meaningful lifecycle date per entity (decide which per entity at that time),
  whichever is cheaper than scrolling a long `<select>`.
  - _Pattern to copy (added 2026-06-01):_ `ContactPicker.svelte` (used by
    `DuplicateJobPage`) does server-side `?search=` typeahead against `/api/contacts/`
    with prefill-by-id — the shape these capped pickers should move to.

- **Review site-wide `z-index` usage; decide whether to impose a scale.** — _added 2026-05-26_
  We added an ad-hoc `z-index: 30` to `.job-header` (plus `z-index: 1` on
  `.hold-reason-form`) in commit `270c79d` to lift the on-hold reason popover above the
  page body. The SPA has no documented z-index scale, so stacking values are chosen
  one-off across headers, the `lib/api.js` error/success overlays, modals
  (`WorkerTimePromptModal`, `StartWorkConflictModal`), sticky bands (`CurrentBlepBand`),
  and dropdowns. Risk: silent collisions and "why is this behind that?" surprises.
  _Done when:_ we've grepped `frontend/src` for `z-index`, catalogued the values and the
  layers they represent, and either confirmed they're conflict-free or defined a small
  documented scale (e.g. content < sticky < dropdown < popover < modal < toast) and
  migrated the existing values onto it.

- **Job header is cramped for the on-hold reason capture; revisit the fixed 110px height.** — _added 2026-05-26_
  The on-hold reason form now pops over the page (commit `270c79d`), but the job header
  is a fixed `height: 110px` grid with vertically-centered content, so the form has to
  *overflow* the header rather than the header accommodating it. It works, but a
  transient form escaping its container is a layout smell.
  _Done when:_ either the header accommodates the reason capture cleanly (a proper
  modal/popover, or a header that can grow), or we've decided the overflow-popover is
  fine and noted why.

- **Decide a consistent primary-key naming convention for line items (and documents).** — _added 2026-05-26_
  The codebase uses explicit PK names (`line_item_id`, `estimate_id`, `change_order_id`)
  instead of Django's default `id`. This bit us in the CO UI — the frontend assumed
  `.id`, producing the `/change-orders/undefined` redirect + empty links (fixed in
  `a1c4ff2`). Note: all line-item types **already share `line_item_id`** (via
  `BaseLineItem`), so DRY-ing the repeated line-item code (a shared base serializer,
  `LineItemMixin`, the shared `LineItemTable`/`WizardLineItemCard`) is *already* possible
  on that common name — switching to `id` wouldn't unlock new consolidation; it would
  match Django/DRF defaults and stop the recurring "I assumed `.id`" bug.
  _Options:_ (a) keep the explicit names and document the convention loudly;
  (b) expose a read-only `id` alias in the line-item serializers — cheap, no DB
  migration, lets shared frontend code rely on `.id`; (c) full rename to `id` — large,
  risky, and leaves parent docs inconsistent unless they're renamed too.
  _Done when:_ we've picked one and either applied it or recorded the decision.

- **Should an Estimate with a change order on it stay `accepted`, or become `superseded`?** — _added 2026-05-26_
  The CO display paradigm treats estimate ⊕ CO as the current agreement and pushes the
  prior estimate into a superseded-like history slot — but the backend keeps the estimate
  `accepted`. Decide whether the *model* should actually supersede the estimate when a CO
  is accepted (cleaner model↔display match) or keep it `accepted` and let the display
  relabel (current). Interacts with the "one accepted estimate per job" rule and the
  `ChangeOrder.estimate` FK.
  _Done when:_ we've decided and either changed the model or written down why `accepted` stays.

- **Audit confirmations site-wide — confirm only the irreversible.** — _added 2026-05-27_
  We removed `confirm()` dialogs from the change-order line/deliverable edits (Change /
  Delete-of-a-draft-delta / Undo / New) — all exactly undoable by another local action.
  Sweep the SPA for `confirm(...)` and remove any guarding a reversible action; keep them
  only where the action is irreversible or extremely arduous to undo (deleting a persisted
  record, sending to a customer). Convention recorded in CLAUDE.md "UI Decisions".
  _Done when:_ confirmations across the SPA match the rule.

- **Validate the multi-change-order display (2+ COs).** — _added 2026-05-27_
  We spec'd `ch-1`/`ch-2` per-line tags but haven't built/validated how the CO view reads
  with two or more COs on a job: how the 1st CO's lines/deliverables show once a 2nd
  exists, and how the 2nd (and further) indicate they're later versions layered on the
  prior agreement. Look at this before closing the branch.
  _Done when:_ the CO view is legible with ≥2 COs (version layering + ch-N tags read clearly).

- **Distinguish on-hold job varieties on the pipeline panel?** — _added 2026-05-27_
  An on-hold job shows a single "on-hold" sub-status. Consider surfacing whether it has a
  CO and the CO's state (none / draft / open / accepted-awaiting-release). May only matter
  while testing — decide if it's worth the extra signal.
  _Done when:_ decided (implemented or dropped).

- **Sweep `apps/api/` for `serializer.save()` bypasses — every mutation must go through a Service.** — _added 2026-05-27_
  We just found four API paths that called DRF `serializer.save()` (or `.update()`) directly
  instead of routing through the service-layer method that holds the guards: the task PATCH,
  the task-materials create + update, and the materials PATCH. Each one silently bypassed the
  on_hold freeze and would similarly bypass any future service-layer guard, side-effect, or
  invariant. The convention is **every mutating endpoint goes through a Service** — that's
  where validation, guards, and side-effects live, with `ValidationError` translated to 400.
  Direct DRF saves in views should be effectively zero in this codebase. Grep `apps/api/` for
  `is_valid` + `serializer.save()` / `.update()` and route any remaining bypasses through the
  appropriate service.
  _Done when:_ no mutating API view writes via the DRF serializer directly; all go through a
  Service.

- **`Blep.user` is nullable — it shouldn't be.** — _added 2026-05-30_
  `Blep.user = ForeignKey('core.User', ..., null=True, blank=True)`. A logged time
  entry with no worker attached is meaningless, and it complicates the work-shifts
  enclosure invariant (a null-`user` blep can't belong to anyone's shift — see the
  backfill addendum in `docs/plans/2026-05-30-work-shifts-design.md` §14). Make `user`
  required once any existing null-`user` bleps are cleaned up.
  _Done when:_ `Blep.user` is non-nullable and the data has no orphaned (null-`user`) bleps.

- **Notify the requester when an approval request is approved/denied.** — _added 2026-05-31_
  Workers get no feedback when a manager acts on their request — they only find out by
  re-checking the list. Applies to **time-change requests** (shift + blep, the
  `ShiftChangeRequest`/`BlepChangeRequest` approve/deny actions) AND **expense
  reimbursements** (the expense approve/reject flow). Want some notification channel
  (in-app banner/badge, email, or a "what changed since you last looked" surface) so the
  requester learns the outcome without polling. Ties into the broader cross-client
  live-refresh idea ([[project_general_repolling]]).
  _Done when:_ a requester is notified (by whatever agreed channel) of approve/deny
  outcomes for both time-change requests and expense reimbursements.

- **Time managers can't reach the shift request queue / payroll report.** — _added 2026-05-31_
  `ShiftRequestQueue` + `PayrollReport` live on the **Shifts tab of the Users page**
  (`routes/users/UserListPage.svelte`), but the "Users" sidebar link is gated on
  `can_manage_config` (`Sidebar.svelte`). A manager with `can_manage_time` (or
  `can_manage_financials` for the report) but not `can_manage_config` has no nav path to
  it — exactly the people meant to approve requests / run payroll. Likely fix: a dedicated
  "Shifts"/"Time" sidebar link gated on `can_manage_time OR can_manage_financials` routing
  to a small page that hosts the queue + report, decoupled from user-admin.
  _Done when:_ a `can_manage_time`/`can_manage_financials` manager can navigate to the
  request queue and payroll report without `can_manage_config`.

- **Surface the conflicting *shift* for a blep change request that needs a wider shift.** — _added 2026-05-31_
  The request queue now lists conflicting records (`conflicts`): a shift request shows the
  bleps it would orphan, and a blep request shows the worker's *overlapping* shifts to
  widen. But a blep request whose new time has **no** overlapping shift at all (worked a
  span with no shift) surfaces nothing to open — the manager must create a shift, and there's
  no manager UI to create/edit an arbitrary worker's shift outside this queue's modal.
  _Done when:_ a manager can resolve a blep request that needs a brand-new shift (create one)
  directly from the review flow.

- **Re-billing Task actuals across multiple invoices.** — _added 2026-06-02_
  Invoices can be raised before a job is finished (e.g. progress billing). If invoice #1 is
  finalized and bills the actuals of Task A, then Task A gets more work logged, and later
  invoice #2 is generated for the same job, it's unclear how Task A's actuals are handled on
  the second invoice — does it re-bill the full actual (double-billing the earlier portion),
  bill only the delta since invoice #1, or refuse the atom as already-claimed? The atom-claim
  model (`InvoiceLineItemSource`) tracks which invoice claimed an atom, but a Task whose
  actuals *grew* after being billed has no defined delta-billing behavior. Decide and enforce
  the rule (likely: bill the unbilled delta, tracked per source).
  _Done when:_ generating a later invoice for a Task already partially billed produces the
  correct (non-duplicated) amount, with a test covering the grow-after-bill case.

- **Invoice revisions — back the "Revise (coming soon)" placeholder.** — _added 2026-06-04_
  `InvoiceDetailPage.svelte` shows a **disabled** "Revise (coming soon)" button on sent
  invoices (`canSeeRevise`), shipped as a placeholder — there is no invoice-revision backend
  (no `InvoiceService.revise`, no supersede/version chain like estimates have). Decide
  whether invoices need a revise flow at all (vs. cancel + new invoice) and, if so, build the
  backend + wire the button. _Done when:_ either the placeholder is backed by a working
  invoice-revise flow, or it's removed with a recorded decision that invoices don't revise.

- **Merge the source-pull ("wizard") view into the detail page as an in-place toggle.** — _added 2026-06-02_
  The estimate/invoice detail pages link out to a separate `/…/:id/wizard` route for the
  atom-pull view ("Show Worksheet" / "Show Billables"). That's approach (a): a rename + a
  navigation. Approach (b) — deferred here — is to make the source-pull surface an in-place
  *view toggle* on the detail page itself (no separate route), so the "normal" and "pull from
  source" views share one page, one header, and one load. Bigger restructure (folds
  `EstimateWizardPage`/`InvoiceWizardPage` into the detail components). Until then, the two
  views' headers are kept visually matched so the navigation feels seamless.
  _Done when:_ the detail page can switch between the line-item view and the atom-pull view
  without a route change, and the standalone wizard routes are retired.

- **Audit frontend ↔ backend permission gating for parity.** — _added 2026-06-02_
  The SPA frequently shows an action whose gate doesn't match the backend permission its
  endpoint requires, so the user sees a button that then 403s (or, less often, a button is
  hidden from someone the backend would allow). Known example: `InvoiceDetailPage.svelte`'s
  "Send/Resend Invoice" link is gated on `canEditInvoice` (`can_manage_jobs` **or**
  `can_manage_financials`), but the invoice `send` action requires `can_manage_financials`
  only — a jobs-only user sees a Send button that 403s. (The "Continue in wizard" link had the
  same mismatch and was removed.) This is a broad, recurring pattern, not a one-off — do a
  systematic pass: for each gated action in the SPA, confirm the frontend visibility condition
  matches the atom enforced by the corresponding viewset/`get_permissions` (atoms:
  `can_manage_jobs`, `can_manage_financials`, `can_manage_time`, `can_manage_config`; see
  `docs/designs/users-and-permissions.md` §3 for the endpoint-to-atom table). Prefer a small
  shared permission helper/derived per atom so gates are consistent rather than ad-hoc per page.
  _Done when:_ no SPA action is shown to a user the backend would reject (and none is hidden
  from a user the backend would allow), verified against the endpoint-to-atom mapping.

- **Stale-view error handling + live refresh after a concurrent change.** — _added 2026-06-03_
  Two users with the same job open: one creates the estimate, the other's Create-Estimate
  button is still present and clickable. The backend correctly rejects the second create with
  a note, but the stale view doesn't refresh — the dead button stays. General pattern: a page
  showing another client's mutable state should both (a) surface the rejection cleanly and
  (b) re-fetch so the now-invalid affordance disappears. A small live-refresh system already
  exists for bleps/shifts; the natural move is to generalize it into one shared cross-client
  refresh mechanism (see the "general repolling" project note) rather than bolt on per-page
  polling. Not for this round. _Done when:_ a view that loses an action to a concurrent change
  refreshes to hide the stale affordance, and the rejection is shown without a raw error.

- **Make the Estimate and Invoice atom/source-pull UIs consistent.** — _added 2026-06-03_
  The atom-pull ("wizard") surfaces for Estimates and Invoices look noticeably different, so a
  user who learns one doesn't recognize the other. They should share interaction vocabulary and
  layout so the pattern transfers. _Done when:_ the Estimate and Invoice atom-pull views present
  the same structure and controls (differing only where the domains genuinely differ).

- **Wizard's by-hand line item uses an inline editor, not the LineItemModal.** — _added 2026-06-03_
  Adding a manual line item from the detail page uses the new `LineItemModal` (manual/catalog
  toggle), but adding one inside the wizard uses a separate inline editor (likely the same one
  used when grouping atoms). Two different entry surfaces for "add a line item by hand" is
  confusing. Converge on one. _Done when:_ adding a manual line item uses the same component
  whether on the detail page or in the wizard.

- **Should a superseded estimate's tab navigate to the current estimate?** — _added 2026-06-03_
  In job view, clicking a superseded estimate's tab shows that (old) estimate in the pillar, and
  its "View Full Estimate" link correctly points to the old one. Open question: should clicking
  the tab itself jump straight to the current live estimate instead of showing the superseded
  one? Unsure which is less confusing. _Done when:_ the superseded-tab click behavior is decided
  and consistent.
